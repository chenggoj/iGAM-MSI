Introduction
iGAM-MSI is a repository containing code and trained machine learning models for studying Metal-Support Interactions (MSI) using Interpretable Generalized Additive Models (iGAM). This project leverages the power of iGAM to provide accurate and explainable predictions in materials science.
About iGAM (or Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM))
Interpretable Generalized Additive Models (iGAM) or Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)is a decision-tree based machine learning model designed to offer accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods like Random Forest and Boosted Trees, while maintaining high interpretability.
For a detailed overview of iGAMs, please refer to the original EBM link (https://github.com/interpretml/interpret/)

Key features of iGAM include:

Modern machine learning techniques
Automatic MSI prediction
High interpretability
Fast prediction times
